    :::: WAYS TO STYLE ::::


        All the following work, and work hierarchically to each other.
        Highest takes precedence, but lowest (external file) is cleanest.
        ...........................

        Inline CSS:

            Means things are styled in the html file not in css file.

            Can be in object:

                <body style="background-color: black">
                </body>

        In Style Tag:

            head>
                <meta charset="utf-8">
                <title>Tim'a Personal Site</title>
            </head>

            <style>
                body {
                    background-color: black
                }
            </style>

        External CSS file:

            1. Create style sheet           :: styles.css
            2. Link file in HTML head       :: <link rel="stylesheet" href="/CV/css/styles.css">

    
        
    :::: OBJECT HIERARCHY ::::

        - tag                   :: img
            - class             :: .Classname    (objects can have >1 class) ex. class="mail inbox"
                - id            :: #IDname       (each id has to be unique)



    :::: PSUEDO CLASSES ::::

        Classes based on object state.

        Ex.
                :active {}
                :hover {}        img:hover { background-color: black}





    :::: KNOWLEDGE ::::

        - Many ppl use tags and classes to style, not ids
        - Linters actually suggest against using ids
