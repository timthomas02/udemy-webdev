    :::: GRAMMAR ::::

    selector {property: value;}

    :::: WAYS TO STYLE ::::

    All the following work, and work hierarchically to each other.
    Highest takes precedence, but lowest (external file) is cleanest.

    :::: ------------- ::::

    Inline CSS:

        Means things are styled in the html file not in css file.

        Can be in object:

            <body style="background-color: blue">
            </body>

    In Style Tag:

        head>
            <meta charset="utf-8">
            <title>Tim'a Personal Site</title>
        </head>

        <style>
            body {
                background-color: blue
            }
        </style>

    External CSS file:

        1. Create style sheet           :: styles.css
        2. Link file in HTML head       :: <link rel="stylesheet" href="/CV/css/styles.css">
